## Overview

Build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action
